=======

jabberd is the original Jabber/XMPP server developped by:

Jeremie Miller <jeremie@jabber.org>  
Keith Minkler <tsbandit@jabber.org>  
Thomas Muldowney <temas@jabber.org>  
Schuyler Heath <sheath@jabber.org>  
David Smith <dizzyd@jabber.org>  
Matthias Wimmer <m@tthias.eu>  
Maqi <maqi@jabberstudio.org>

There are now several implementations for XMPP servers. You can find a list of
them on <https://xmpp.org/software/servers.html>

The source code of jabberd is available on
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/jabberd/jabberd) and
[GitHub](https://github.com/mawis/jabberd). You can get the source from both of
these places, but please take note, that if you are interested in the
integration test results, you have to check them on GitLab.

The home of jabberd is <https://jabberd.org/>.
